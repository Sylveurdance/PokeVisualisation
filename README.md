# PokeVisualisation
This code is parsing pokedex, doing some clustering/classification and allows to see pokemon that look like


Improvements :
- Graph Visualization Pokemon/Attaques
- Make an Expert System (Tree made by human) and compare it with a Decision Tree (Tree made by computer (after a training)) with more rules
